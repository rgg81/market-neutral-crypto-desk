"""Phase 9 — paper-trading P&L ledger (Position + PaperAccount).

REUSES the cost primitives — it NEVER re-implements fee/funding/slippage math:
  * costs.trade_fee / costs.count_funding_events
  * funding_intervals.clamp_funding_rate / funding_intervals.realized_funding
  * slippage.estimate_slippage

Funding sign convention (load-bearing): this ledger settles funding via
`funding_intervals.realized_funding`, which is BALANCE-credit perspective (a SHORT with a positive
rate RECEIVES funding -> a POSITIVE cash credit). Do NOT use `costs.project_funding` here (that is
the opposite, cost/paid perspective).

Funding clock (load-bearing): the account carries its OWN `last_funding_ts`, advanced by
`settle_funding`. The equity series is NOT a safe `prev_ts` source — `equity_log.record_equity` keys
only on `cycle`, so weekly cycle 1 and daily cycle 1 collide and the daily point overwrites the
weekly one in a single run.

Closed-leg carrier (load-bearing): the realized outcome of a FULLY closed leg survives in the
account-level aggregates but NOT on any Position (it is popped). To patch each closed leg's realized
costs onto the Decision that OPENED it ("at close"), `_reconcile_opposite` snapshots a `ClosedLeg`
(carrying its open cycle+cadence and realized fees/slippage/funding/price-pnl) into `closed_legs`
before popping. The close-time journal patch keys each on its OWN open cycle+cadence — never the
current cycle — and `drain_closed_legs` empties the buffer so a leg is patched exactly once.
