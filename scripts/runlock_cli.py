# scripts/runlock_cli.py
"""Single-flight run-lock CLI (SKILL.md W1/W12/D1/D8): the dual-cadence desk is orchestrated by
Claude across MANY separate CLI processes, so each cadence acquires the lock at the START of its
meeting and releases it at the END — exactly one writer at a time over the shared book.

    uv run python scripts/runlock_cli.py acquire --owner weekly   # ACQUIRED | LOCKED: <holder>
    uv run python scripts/runlock_cli.py release --owner weekly    # RELEASED
    uv run python scripts/runlock_cli.py status                    # FREE | HELD: <holder>

Closes I1 (runlock_cli.py named in SKILL.md but absent; runlock.py had no CLI). `acquire` exits 0 on
ACQUIRED, 0 on LOCKED (the caller stands down — not an error), 2 on internal error. A crashed
meeting that never releases is auto-reclaimed after `runlock.DEFAULT_STALE_AFTER_S`. The state
root flag is
`--state-dir` (consistent with the rest of the Phase 8 CLI family)."""
